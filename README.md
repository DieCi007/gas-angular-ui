# G-UI

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.
It contains utility services and common components used for my project [GasAdvisor](https://www.gasadvisor.it).

This was a solution for getting used with creating Angular libraries and not using duplicated components/code in my frontend applications [GasAdvisor | Admin Console](https://github.com/DieCi007/gas-console) and [GasAdvisor | Frontend](https://github.com/DieCi007/gas-frontend)

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project g-ui` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project g-ui`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project g-ui` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build g-ui` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
